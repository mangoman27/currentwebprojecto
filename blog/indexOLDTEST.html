			<h2>Welcome to the Blog!</h2>
			<p>This is a placeholder for the links on the right! So its absolutely pointless to observer and read what is here because it is utterly useless and is a most efficient waste of 
			your time. It contains no valuable information 
			is truly of no importance for you, the foolish reader. Some may say its just filled with utter bullshit from yours truly, 
			and I'm inclined to agree. Alas, that is all, please enjoy my Blog and browse to your hearts contempt.</p>

		 <h3>03/03/2024</h3>
			<p> 	So today I decided to procrastinate even more and I fixed some typo's in the previous posts , heck I even added a cute update message in the bottom right of each newly revised blog entry. I plan to add a seperate updates page because it seems I keep dumping them here, on the blog. <br><br>Another thing to note is that the site is now 99% mobile compatible , that 1% is the title on the header saying when the site was last updated in general. I cant manage to get it to fit on mobile and applying an zero opacity filter in css does not seem to work, I think I know why its not working but I will likely solve it tomorrow or something.
