			<p> I have just created an seperate blog entry to the one below to express my excietment and joy  that my site has finally been crawled by google itself!!!! So you can now directly look it up on google, provided you type the full of address lol.

			So recently I was able to find a way to make a modular header and footer in js instead of php and today is the day I finally implement the update , 
			Huzzah indeed! Now this does bring up some problems I will need to iron out, meaning I cannot use js in the footer and header because apparently you cant
			include a js file inside another js file...... Who would’ve thought?! Oh well, i’m sure I will find a workaround sooner or later. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Now if your want to use this code for your own site, I will leave a simple template below to download because displaying it is a pain in the ass.
			</p>
			<button><a href="modular js header and footer.zip">Download</a></button>

				<p> So today I have decided to migrate my site to github pages, I have chosen to do this because 000webhost archived my site and wanted to force me to pay for a subscription. So, github pages here I come! If anyone knows how to create a .htaccess file in github pages please email
					me lol because I tried an .md file and a regular .htaccess file and they did not work, im pretty noobish when it comes to github & gituhb pages in general. If i could access my bank account , I would likely host this site on a a webserver on a vps,but according to the bank, I have too wait two more years, thanks obama :/</p>

				 <p>Today has been  ok. Unfortunately my m42 camera BROKE!! (zenit ttl) , aghgfghagahag. Oh welll, atleast i still have my  ricoh kr-5 and the f2.8 sigma 28mm (nice lens). Honestly im wondering if i should just buy a new zenit/praktica in the turkish antique market . But im probabily just gonna buy an adapter for the ricoh kr-5, i want to do the latter but the adapter wouldnt come in time for christmas and i want to use the lens when im visiting my family, soooo, we shall see.</p>
