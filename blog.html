		<p>I know not many ppl visit my site, but in the off chance you recently tried visiting on lusitania.eu.org,  i took my site offline and said it would it be back by December.... Well yh, long story short, i was having problems with my laptop so i couldnt do much on holiday. But we're back now! So what did i add? Not much, all i did was steal zonelet's css and add a gallery using https://netfriend.neocities.org/ez-gallery/
		<br><br>P.S i will right about some stuff that happened in Turkiye but rn im too friggin lazy
		<br><br>P.S P.S i also lost my last blog entry? soooooo, uhhh, considered that perma deleted?

	 <p>Today has been  ok. Unfortunately my m42 camera BROKE!! (zenit ttl) , aghgfghagahag. Oh welll, atleast i still have my  ricoh kr-5 and the f2.8 sigma 28mm (nice lens). Honestly im wondering if i should just buy a new zenit/praktica in the turkish antique market . But im probabily just gonna buy an adapter for the ricoh kr-5, i want to do the latter but the adapter wouldnt come in time for christmas and i want to use the lens when im visiting my family, soooo, we shall see.
